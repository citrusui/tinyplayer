# tp-site

A redesigned version of the [TinyPlayer website](http://ziph0n.byethost3.com).

Unfinished, as [@Ziph0n](https://twitter.com/Ziph0n) rejected my offer to code his website for him. Oh well.

Built using vanilla Bootstrap 3.3.6, jQuery 2.2.4, and CSS from the Bootstrap docs.

No warranty is implied; I am not liable for any damages caused by using this code. Additionally, I can not guarantee support for those who use this repository. However, feel free to open Pull Requests. I'll be happy to accept them.

Bootstrap, jQuery, and this repo are under the MIT License. Since I forgot to add a copy of the MIT license, [here you go](http://citrusui.mit-license.org).
